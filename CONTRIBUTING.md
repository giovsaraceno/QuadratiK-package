-   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
-   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

## Workflow

The `QuadratiK` package has been engineered with a combination of R and C++ code to balance usability with high-speed computation, catering to complex data analysis needs. The package has undergone extensive testing with various examples. Continuous integration practices have been employed to maintain high standards of reliability and functionality.

`QuadratiK` was first released on CRAN on February 23, 2024. Regular updates and bug fixes are planned to continually enhance the package's functionality and user experience. We are actively planning to include additional methods based on the kernel-based quadratic-distance. One of our primary goals is to make `QuadratiK` increasingly user-friendly, with improvements to the user experience and the layout of the outputs. User feedback is highly valued and will be a key driver of future development.

This Life Cycle Statement is subject to periodic review and will be updated to reflect the evolving nature of `QuadratiK`.
