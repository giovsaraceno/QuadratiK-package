QuadratiK 1.1.3 (2025-02-04) 
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * the function rpkb() returns directly the generated data set and not a list.
  * change repository name from QuadratiK-package to QuadratiK.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * packages ggplot2 and foreach not called as full packages but using 
    importFrom.
  * nClust argument of pkbc function has no default value.
  * usage of standardGeneric (see https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s4.html#s4-generics).
  
### BUG FIXES

  * goodpractice suggestions.
  * specify that rho in pk.test() cannot be equal 1.
  * styling and spelling errors.

### DOCUMENTATION FIXES

  * Uniform notation: d is dimension in Eucldean space with spherical data lying
    on the (d-1)-dimensional sphere
  * Specify dimension of input matrix x in clustering functions.
  * Improve explanation of Average Silhouette Width.
  * Better explanation of motivation for L2 normalization in the wireless data
    set application.


QuadratiK 1.1.2 (2024-10-29) 
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * Added NEWS.md file.
  
  * More detailed information in the README file and documentation (the methods 
    are more usable and clearer for a broader audience). 

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Added badges for rOpenSci review status, test coverage, R CMD CHECK,
    CRAN downloads.
  * Addition of test codes with testthat package. 
  * In particular, testing that random sampling from the PKBD and the wrapped
          Cauchy distribution is equivalent.
  
### BUG FIXES

  * scatter-plots related to the clustering algorithm results.
  * computation of evaluation measures (`pkdc_validation` function) when the 
    true labels are not provided.

### DOCUMENTATION FIXES

  * The help documentation for the methods defined for the classes in the 
    package can be accessed directly (addition of roxygen tag name and 
    aliases).


QuadratiK 1.1.1 (2024-06-05)
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * Improve computation of variance for k-sample test
  * Add `breast_cancer` and `wine` data sets
  
### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * `print()` and `summary()` methods of the `kb.test` object for the two and k-sample tests
  
### BUG FIXES

  * Computation of test statistics for normality test

### DOCUMENTATION FIXES

  * Correction of typos
