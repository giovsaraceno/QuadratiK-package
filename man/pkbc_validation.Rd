\usage{
pkbc_validation(object, true_label = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class \code{pkbc}}

\item{true_label}{factor or vector of true membership to clusters (if
available). It must have the same length of final
memberships.}
}
\value{
List with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{metrics} Table of computed evaluation measures for each value
of number of clusters in the \code{pkbc} object. The
number of cluster is indicated as column name.
\item \code{IGP} List of in-group proportions for each value of number of
clusters specified.
}
}
\description{
Method for objects of class \code{pkbc} which computes evaluation measures
for clustering results.
The following evaluation measures are computed:
In-Group Proportion (Kapp and Tibshirani (2007)). If true label are
provided, ARI, Average Silhouette Width (Rousseeuw (1987)), Macro-Precision
and Macro-Recall are computed.
}
\details{
The IGP is a statistical measure that quantifies the proportion of
observations within a group that belong to the same predefined category or
class. It is often used to assess the homogeneity of a group by evaluating
how many of its members share the same label. A higher IGP indicates that the
group is more cohesive, while a lower proportion suggests greater diversity
or misclassification within the group (Kapp and Tibshirani 2007).

The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) is a statistical measure used in data
clustering analysis. It quantifies the similarity between two partitions of
a dataset by comparing the assignments of data points to clusters. The ARI
value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect match
between the partitions and a value close to 0 indicates a random assignment
of data points to clusters.

The average silhouette width quantifies the quality of clustering by
measuring how well each object fits within its assigned cluster. It is the
mean of silhouette values, which compare the tightness of an object within
its cluster to its separation from other clusters. Higher values indicate
well-separated, cohesive clusters, making it useful for selecting the
\emph{appropriate} number of clusters (Rousseeuw 1987).

Macro Precision is a metric used in multi-class classification that
calculates the precision for each class independently and then takes the
average of these values. Precision for a class is defined as the proportion
of true positive predictions out of all predictions made for that class.

Macro Recall is similar to Macro Precision but focuses on recall. Recall for
a class is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual
instances of that class. Macro Recall is the average of the recall values
computed for each class.
}
\note{
Note that Macro Precision and Macro Recall depend on the assigned labels,
while the ARI measures the similarity between partition up to label
switching.

If the required packages (\code{mclust} for ARI, \code{clusterRepro} for IGP, and
\code{cluster} for ASW) are not installed, the function will display a message
asking the user to install the missing package(s).
