QuadratiK provides the first implementation, in R and Python, of a
comprehensive set of goodness-of-fit tests and a clustering technique for
spherical data using kernel-based quadratic distances. It includes:
Goodness-of-Fit Tests: The software implements one, two, and
k-sample tests for goodness of fit, offering an efficient and
mathematically sound way to assess the fit of probability distributions.
Expanded capabilities include supporting tests for uniformity on the
d-dimensional Sphere based on Poisson kernel densities. Our tests are
particularly useful for large, high dimensional data sets where the
assessment of fit of probability models is of interest. Specifically, we
offer tests for normality, as well as two- and k-sample tests, where
testing equality of two or more distributions is of interest, that is
\(H_0: F_1 = F_2\) and \(H_0: F_1 = \ldots = F_k\) respectively.
The proposed tests perform well in terms of level and power for contiguous
alternatives, heavy tailed distributions and in higher dimensions.
Poisson kernel-based distribution (PKBD): the package offers
functions for computing the density value and for generating random samples
from a PKBD. The Poisson kernel-based densities are based on the normalized
Poisson kernel and are defined on the $d$-dimensional unit sphere. Given a
vector \(\mu \in \mathcal{S}^{d-1}\), and a parameter \(\rho\) such that
\(0 &amp;lt; \rho &amp;lt; 1\), the probability density function of a \(d\)-variate
Poisson kernel-based density is defined by: $$f(\mathbf{x}|\rho,
 \mathbf{\mu}) = \frac{1-\rho^2}{\omega_d ||\mathbf{x} -
 \rho \mathbf{\mu}||^d},$$ where \(\mu\) is a vector orienting the center of
the distribution, \(\rho\) is a parameter to control the concentration of
the distribution around the vector \(\mu\) and it is related to the
variance of the distribution. Furthermore,
\(\omega_d = 2\pi^{d/2} [\Gamma(d/2)]^{-1}\) is the surface area of the
unit sphere in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (see Golzy and Markatou, 2020).
Clustering Algorithm for Spherical Data: the package incorporates a
unique clustering algorithm specifically tailored for spherical data and it
is especially useful in the presence of noise in the data and the presence
of non-negligible overlap between clusters. This algorithm leverages a
mixture of Poisson kernel-based densities on the Sphere, enabling effective
clustering of spherical data or data that has been spherically transformed.
The package also provides the functions for density evaluation and random
sampling from the Poisson kernel-based distribution.
Additional Features: Alongside these functionalities, the software
includes additional graphical functions, aiding users in validating and
representing the cluster results as well as enhancing the interpretability
and usability of the analysis.
